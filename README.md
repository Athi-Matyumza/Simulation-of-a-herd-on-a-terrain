# SIMHERD Project Overview

## Abstract

The SIMHERD project introduces an interactive simulation platform enabling users, including educators, researchers, enthusiasts, and data analysts, to explore animal behaviors across diverse terrains. This platform facilitates real-time observation of herd dynamics, modification of Boid parameters, and data export for Unity 3D rendering. Users can adjust separation, alignment, and cohesion force weights, allowing in-depth investigation into the subtleties of herd behavior. The intuitive GUI simplifies the insertion of environmental elements, fostering exploration of animal-environment interactions. Immediate view 2D animations offer compelling representations, while analysis tools enhance understanding. SIMHERD serves as a flexible and instructive tool for academic research, educational presentations, and ecological investigations.

## 1. Introduction

The animation of animal herds plays a crucial role in visual storytelling across various digital media. SIMHERD, an acronym for Simulating Herds on Varied Terrain, focuses on revolutionizing the portrayal and interaction with animal herds. Building upon Craig Reynold's Boids model, SIMHERD extends the scope to land-dwelling animals, considering individual species' characteristics and terrain nuances. The project integrates environmental factors like slopes, trees, and water, elevating realism and engagement. Animated herds generated by SIMHERD find a home in the immersive realms of the Unity gaming engine, providing new avenues for creativity.

## 2. Technological Expertise and User Control

SIMHERD employs advanced technological expertise and agent-based algorithms to simulate herds realistically. Despite the complexity, user control is paramount. The project offers a user-friendly experience through a simple GUI, enabling users to interact with both the landscape and animal behavior. Users can dynamically transform the environment by "painting" objects onto the terrain, observing their impact on herds. Real-time preview capabilities empower users to fine-tune simulations to match their creative vision.

## 3. Development Strategy

The SIMHERD development strategy embraces agile concepts, user-centered design, continuous testing through behavioral observation, and iterative refinement. The project follows a flexible and feature-rich approach that caters to a diverse audience while maintaining scalability and performance. Stakeholder input throughout the process ensures alignment with real-world use cases. The use of throw-away prototyping facilitates efficient development and adaptation.
